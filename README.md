### Hiya 👋

I'm Jon, bachelor student in CompSci. I enjoy tackling problems with coding, and optimizing my code for elegance and performance. I endorse the idea of the modern renaissance man. My main interest at the moment is in machine learning, aside from which I also enjoy reading about finance, neuroscience, physics, nature, and whichever process I'm trying to model. If you're interested in my projects or would like to hear more about my journey, you can reach me on discord by <em>jonmhm</em>, or by <a href="jh.tjemsland@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>.

My goto languages are C#, Python and Typescript. HLSL if I'm feeling frisky. 😁 I find Go syntax to be a modern tragedy.

# What I have been up to:
- Learning Typescript! Check out this smooth, low-latency [Graphing Calculator](https://github.com/jon-tj/Typescript-Testing/tree/main/Typescript%20Graphing%20Calculator) i made 😉
- Modeling stock markets. Naturally, most of my research is undisclosed, but feel free to take a look at this [public repository](https://github.com/jon-tj/stocks-trading-flask) for inspiration 😎
- Making a [physics simulation environment](https://github.com/jon-tj/PhysSketch) using Verlet integration! You can create and test simple particle-based models and edit in real time.
