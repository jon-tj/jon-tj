### Hiya 👋

My name is Jon, and I'm studying for my master's degree in Data Science to become an AI engineer. I enjoy tackling problems with coding, and optimizing my code for elegance and performance. I enjoy learning about various topics as tools to understand the world, such as physics, statistics and economy. If you're interested in my projects or would like to hear more about my journey, you can reach out to me on discord by <em>jonmhm</em>, or by <a href="jh.tjemsland@gmail.com" target="_blank">email</a>.

I am currently employed as a software engineer in an internationally renowned firm, and love to learn more about the industry, the people and the technology!

My goto languages are C#, Python and Typescript. HLSL if I'm feeling frisky. 😁

# What I have been up to:
- Learning Typescript! Check out this smooth, low-latency [Graphing Calculator](https://github.com/jon-tj/Typescript-Testing/tree/main/Typescript%20Graphing%20Calculator) i made 😉
- Modeling stock markets. Naturally, most of my research is undisclosed, but feel free to take a look at this [public repository](https://github.com/jon-tj/stocks-trading-flask) for inspiration 😎
- Making a [physics simulation environment](https://github.com/jon-tj/PhysSketch) using Verlet integration! You can create and test simple particle-based models and edit in real time.
- Studying and working... 🫠️
